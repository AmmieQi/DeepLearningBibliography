<b>Blog post published at: http://memkite.com/blog/2014/10/18/updates-to-the-deep-learning-bibliography-from-li-dong-and-knut-o-hellan/</b>

We're of course grateful for updates with new bibliography entries to the <a href="http://deeplearning.university">Deep Learning Bibliography</a> from researchers and practitioners in the field <em>(note: we don't mind if you suggest your own papers to the bibliography as long as they are within deep learning).</em>

The update with new bibliography entries today is suggested by <a href="http://gana.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~lidong/">Li Dong</a> (State Key Lab of Software Development Environment, Beihang University in Beijing, China) and <a href="http://knuthellan.com/">Knut O. Hellan</a> (Zedge, Trondheim, Norway).
