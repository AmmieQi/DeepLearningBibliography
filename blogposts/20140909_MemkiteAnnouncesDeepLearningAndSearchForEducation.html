Deep Learning is setting new records in AI-based image recognition, and we've combined Deep Learning with Memkite (Offline) Search for mobile in an educational context.

<strong>Check out <a title="http://deeplearning.education" href="http://deeplearning.education">http://deeplearning.education</a> for a demo video of Deep Learning for Education.</strong>

The basic idea is that kids get used to working with Artificial Intelligence since it is highly likely they will in the future. The task the kids is as follows: 1) read and find an object (e.g. using Wikipedia or a curriculum such as Common Core others that is indexed and searchable using Memkite)

2) film the object from various angles in order to build a Deep Learning based Image classifier for it

3) share the classifier with other kids and teacher, e.g. using a mesh network between mobile devices if there is no or poor network available

4) use a set of deep learning classifiers to detect objects in nature and learn about them

This can of course be adapted to other settings than nature (e.g. urban areas, museums, healthcare, inside classroom).
