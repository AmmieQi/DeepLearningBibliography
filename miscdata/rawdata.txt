[PDF] SimNets: A Generalization of Convolutional Networks
N Cohen, A Shashua - arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.0781, 2014
Abstract: We present a deep layered architecture that generalizes classical convolutional 
neural networks (ConvNets). The architecture, called SimNets, is driven by two operators, 
one being a similarity function whose family contains the convolution operator used in ...

Polypharmacology Modelling Using Proteochemometrics (PCM): Recent Methodological Developments, Applications to Target Families, and Future Prospects
I Cortes-Ciriano, Q ul Ain, V Subramanian, B Lenselink… - MedChemComm, 2014
Proteochemometrics modelling (PCM) is a computational method to model the bioactivity of 
multiple ligands against multiple, related protein targets simultaneously, and it has hence 
been found to be particularly useful when exploring the selectivity and promiscuity of ...

[PDF] Facial Feature Point Detection: A Comprehensive Survey
N Wang, X Gao, D Tao, X Li - arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.1037, 2014
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of facial feature point detection with 
the assistance of abundant manually labeled images. Facial feature point detection favors 
many applications such as face recognition, animation, tracking, hallucination, expression ...

[PDF] Learning Invariant Color Features for Person Re-Identification
RR Varior, G Wang, J Lu - arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.1035, 2014
Abstract: Matching people across multiple camera views known as person re-identification, 
is a challenging problem due to the change in visual appearance caused by varying lighting 
conditions. The perceived color of the subject appears to be different with respect to ...

[PDF] A General-Purpose, Energy-Efficient, and Context-Aware Acoustic Event Detection Platform for Mobile Devices
SMS Nirjon - 2014
Abstract Humans are extremely capable of remembering, recognizing, and acting upon 
hundreds of thousands of different types of acoustic events on a day-to-day basis. Decades 
of research on acoustic sensing have led to the creation of systems that now understand ...

[PDF] A Deep Neural Network Approach to Automatic Birdsong Recognition
HV Koops - 2014
This thesis is an result of research conducted into feature learning techniques with bird 
sound classification as a goal. To achieve this goal, deep neural networks are created, 
which are evaluated using recordings from the LifeCLEF 2014 Bird task (BirdCLEF) data ...

[PDF] Accuracy evaluation of deep belief networks with fixed-point arithmetic
J Jiang, R Hu, L Mikel, Y Dou
Abstract Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are state-of-art Machine Learning techniques and 
one of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms. Training DBNs is 
computationally intensive which naturally leads to investigate FPGA acceleration. Fixed- ...

Binaural Classification for Reverberant Speech Segregation Using Deep Neural Networks
Y Jiang, D Wang, R Liu, Z Feng
Abstract—Speech signal degradation in real environments mainly results from room 
reverberation and concurrent noise. While human listening is robust in complex auditory 
scenes, current speech segregation algorithms do not perform well in noisy and ...

[DOC] Computational modeling and validation of the motor contribution to speech perception
L Badino, AD Ausilio, L Fadiga, G Metta - Top Cogn Sci
Abstract Action perception and recognition are core abilities fundamental for human social 
interaction. A parieto-frontal network (the mirror neuron system) matches visually presented 
biological motion information onto observer's motor representations. This process of ...
